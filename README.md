## This repository will work as our raw data processing unit...

We collect and parse raw threat research from various data points we collect internally and externally for actionable proactive threat-informed defense to our collection database. This is a pipeline that will later ingest to an undisclosed repo and TIP platforms for further processing analysis & production. This will mainly work as a documentation process for our threat researchers who discover significant raw indicators & campaigns but currently don't have time to invest until at a later time...
